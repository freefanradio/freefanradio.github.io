# 🔧 Browse Button SPA Fix

## ✅ **Problem Fixed**

The "Browse All" buttons in empty station slots were using `onclick="window.location.href='/sports/'"` which bypassed the SPA routing system.

## 🛠️ **Solution Applied**

### 1. **Updated Home Page HTML**
- **Before**: `<button onclick="window.location.href='/sports/'">`
- **After**: `<button data-spa-navigate="/sports/">`

### 2. **Enhanced SPA Router**
- Added handler for `[data-spa-navigate]` buttons
- Global click listener now catches both links AND navigation buttons
- Added debugging to show how many navigation buttons are found

### 3. **Pattern for Future Use**
Any button that needs SPA navigation can now use:
```html
<button data-spa-navigate="/target/page/">Navigate</button>
```

## 🧪 **Test the Fix**

1. **Go to Home Page** → Look for empty station slots
2. **Click "Browse All"** button → Should navigate via SPA (no page reload)
3. **Audio continues playing** during navigation! 🎵
4. **Check console** → Should see "SPA - Button navigation to: /sports/"

## 📝 **Technical Details**

The SPA router's click handler now looks for:
- `a` elements (links) 
- `[data-spa-navigate]` elements (buttons)

This pattern allows for both traditional navigation links and action buttons to work seamlessly with the SPA system.

## 🎉 **Status: Complete!**

All navigation (menu links, browse buttons, etc.) now work properly with SPA routing and persistent audio!
