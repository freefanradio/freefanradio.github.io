# 🔧 SPA Home Page Fix Applied

## ✅ **Problem Identified & Fixed**

**Issue**: Home page station buttons weren't working after SPA navigation because they use a different event handling mechanism than regular pages.

## 🛠️ **Solution Implemented**

### 1. **Enhanced SPA Router**
- Updated `initPageScripts()` to handle both types of station buttons:
  - Regular pages: `[data-station]` attributes
  - Home page: `.station-slot` elements with `stationData` properties

### 2. **Global Home Page Initializer**  
- Created `window.initializeHomePageStations()` function
- Calls the existing `initializeRecentStationsView()` when needed
- Ensures home page stations load properly after SPA navigation

### 3. **Enhanced Debugging**
- Added console logging to track SPA navigation events
- Shows how many station buttons/slots are found and processed
- Helps identify any remaining issues

## 🧪 **How to Test**

1. **Start on Home Page** → Click a station → Should play ✅
2. **Navigate Away** → Go to Sports/About page via menu ✅  
3. **Navigate Back** → Return to Home page ✅
4. **Click Station Again** → Should still work! 🎵

## 📝 **Technical Details**

The home page uses dynamic JavaScript to populate station slots with `stationData` properties, while other pages use static HTML with `data-station` attributes. The SPA router now handles both patterns correctly.

## 🎉 **Status: Fixed!**

Your SPA should now work perfectly on both the home page and all other pages, with continuous audio playback during navigation!
